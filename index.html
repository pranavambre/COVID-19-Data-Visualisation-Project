            <p>
              The world is currently experiencing a pandemic of an infectious disease called coronavirus disease 2019, or COVID-19. COVID-19 is caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and is part of a large family of coronaviruses (CoV). Coronaviruses are transmitted from animals to people, with this particular strain of coronavirus thought to have originated from a seafood market in the city of Wuhan in China in late December of 2019.

             Confirmed coronavirus cases in the US increased significantly in the third week of March as testing was made more rapid and overtook China’s on 26 March making the US the world’s most affected country by coronavirus currently, by number of cases.</p> <br><p>
             The coronavirus (COVID-19) disease continues to spread around the world, with almost 8 million cases and 435,700 deaths as of June 15, 2020. In the United States, the number of infections has risen dramatically since the first week of March, and the U.S. now has more confirmed cases and deaths than any other country worldwide. All 50 states have been affected, but New York has the highest number of deaths and has reported more cases than any single country outside of the United States. <br> Testing has been extremely limited in the US, and the federal government has not ordered a nationwide lockdown. This has lest states to respond in drastically different ways as case numbers continue to skyrocket – and those likely underestimate the scope of the problem since the disease is spreading largely undetected.</p>

            <li>The reported case figures on a given date does not necessarily show the number of new cases on that day: this is due to delays in reporting</li>
